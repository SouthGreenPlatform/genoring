## Directory structure of GenoRing

Directories followd by (W) should be writable while those followed by (R) could
be write-protected.

- . (W) (ie. root directory):
  This directory contains the main "genoring.pl" script that will generate the
  "docker-compose.yml" and "modules.yml" files.
  "docker-compose.yml" is automatically generated and should not be manually
  modified as any modification could be lost when "genoring.pl" regenerates that
  file. It is used by "docker compose" to start GenoRing.
  "modules.yml" contains informations about modules used by GenoRing and their
  state. It is only used by GenoRing and could be edited.

- env (W):
  Contains GenoRing module environment variable values. This directory is
  automatically generated by genoring.pl at (module) installation time. The
  contained environment files come from modules' "env" directories and can be
  altered but might be overriden by genoring.pl if a corresponding module is
  reinstalled or reconfigured.

- modules (R):
  Contains available GenoRing modules as well as a module template.
  Each module has its own directory. If a module has a "src" directory, the
  "src" subdirectories should be writable, especially when using ARM
  achitectures as the "Dockerfile" may be automatically generated there by
  "genoring.pl".

- modules/TEMPLATE (R):
  Contains a GenoRing  module template.

- modules/<some_module> (R):
  Contains a GenoRing module. See "Structure of a GenoRing module" for details.

- modules/<some_module>/src/<some_service> (W):
  Contains a module service sources to compile/generate the corresponding Docker
  container.

- volumes (W):
  Contains exposed Docker volumes used by GenoRing containers. Files can be
  modified but often require root priviledges as they are generated by Docker.

- volumes/backups (W):
  Contains GenoRing backups. Each directory contains a backup. The directory
  name is the backup name.

- volumes/data (W):
  Contains (biological) data for modules, in a structured maner.

- volumes/db (W):
  Contains database data.

- volumes/drupal (W):
  Contains Drupal system.

- volumes/drupal/config (W):
  Contains exported Drupal config (for config backups).

- volumes/drupal/php (W):
  Contains PHP configuration file "php.ini" which can be customized. Any
  modification made is sychronized when GenoRing is (re)started.

- volumes/drupal/private (W):
  Contains Drupal private files with restricted access.

- volumes/drupal/vendor (W):
  Contains libraries provided by composer.

- volumes/drupal/web (W):
  Contains main Drupal files.

- volumes/offline (W):
  Contains the "offline.html" file that is displayed when GenoRing is offline.
  It can be customized.

- volumes/proxy (W):
  Contains web server config.

- volumes/proxy/nginx (W):
  Contains nginx configuration file (genoring-fpm.conf) as well as module
  configurations to include as part of the "genoring" service in
  volumes/proxy/nginx/includes

- volumes/proxy/httpd (W):
  Contains Apache HTTPd configuration file as well as module configurations to
  include as part of the "genoring" service in volumes/proxy/httpd/includes


## Structure of a GenoRing module

A GenoRing module template can be found in the GenoRing "modules/TEMPLATE"
directory. A GenoRing module is a directory with the following structure:
- "README.md": a README file explaining the puprose of the module and how it
  works.
- "TOLOCAL.md": a file explaining how to turn Docker service containers into
  "local" services handled either by the server hosting GenoRing or other
  available servers.
- "env": a directory containing environment files used by the module that will
  be use by GenoRing when the module will be enabled, to ask the admin to set
  the environment variable to configure the module and its services.
  Each environment file can hold multiple environment variables, one by line,
  following the format "VARIABLE_NAME=variable value" preceded by comments
  documenting the variable usage. Some @tags should also be present to explain
  how the variable is used:
  - "SET": means it is recommended to customize the variable.
  - "OPT": means the variable can be customize or left as is.
  - "INS": means the variable is used at installation.
  - "RUN": means the variable is used at runtime.

  Ex.:
  ```
    # - Drupal admin account name
    #   @tags: OPT INS
    DRUPAL_USER=genoring
  ```
  It is important do document variables with SET or OPT so they can be managed
  by GenoRing script at installation time: the first line of the comment
  block of a variable should contain the short variable description in one line.
  The next line should be an empty comment line or only contain dashes ('-').
  The nex comment lines should contain the complete description with
  explanations on how to fill the value. The comment block should then contain
  a "@default" annotation followed by a space and the default value (could be
  empty) and the "@tags" annotation stating the use of the variable.
  See "modules/genoring/env/genoring.env" for more examples.
  Note: enabled Docker Compose profiles can be provided to a container through
  an environment variable defined as "COMPOSE_PROFILES=${COMPOSE_PROFILES}".
  See "services" note for details on Docker Compose profiles.
- "services": a set of YAML files containing the Docker definition of each
  service provided by the module. See
  https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/05-services/ for details.
  The definition should not include the "services:" element nor an element name
  for the service and should not include a "container_name" parameter as it will
  be automatically set by GenoRing using the YAML file name. The indentation
  must not include extra-spaces for lisibility as they will be automatically
  managed by the GenoRing script. To avoid conflicts between modules, service
  names should be prefixed by "genoring-" followed by their module name followed
  by a dash, unless a service could be shared amongst multiple modules.
  Note: 5 profiles are managed by GenoRing and can be used in the service
  definitions (ie. "profiles: [...]") to limit the use of a service to a given
  context:
  - "prod": set for production site.
  - "staging": set for staging site.
  - "dev": set for developement site.
  - "backend": only enabled for backend operations like module installation,
    update and uninstallation.
  - "offline": only enabled when the site is offline.
  Without specific profiles, the service is always loaded (if the module is
  enabled).
  Note: The "services" directory may contain a "alt" subdirectory with
  alternative services that can be used to replace the default ones. An
  "alt.yml" file contains alternative settings managed by GenoRing.
  Each alternative is defined by a (machine) name as YAML element key and
  contains a description string ("description" key), a list of substituted
  services (structured as current service name as key and new alternative
  service name as value under the "substitute" key), a list of new services to
  add ("add" key) and a list of services to remove ("remove" key).
- "volumes": a set of YAML files corresponding to named volumes shared accross
  containers. These are not to be confused with volumes that can be defined in
  the services above. A module service can mount a shared volume in its
  "volumes" section but the point is that this shared volume can also be mounted
  by services in other modules for data sharing. See
  https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/07-volumes/ for details.
  Since a same shared volume may be defined in multiple modules, the GenoRing
  script will ensure they use the same definition using the volume's version
  number provided as comment in the volume's YAML file header (ie. "# v1.0").
  The GenoRing script will only keep the latest sub-version definition (ie. if
  there is a 1.0 and a 1.1 definition, it will use the 1.1 definition) or the
  last definition met and will raise an error in case of different major
  versions and abort module activation (ie. 1.0 vs 2.0).
  Note: a 'genoring-' prefix is required to avoid collisions with other volumes
  managed by Docker.
- "hooks": a directory holding hook scripts. Hook scripts may be available or
  not for a given action and can be PERL scripts for local system actions or
  shell scripts (or others) that should be run in module containers. "local
  hooks" are usually called when all containers are down (except for the
  "state.pl" hook) while "container hooks" are launched on running containers
  when the system is fully loaded.
  Those scripts use special names to by triggered on specific events.
  - "backend_<service_name>.sh" will be triggered when GenoRing is started in
    "backend" mode.
  - "backup.pl" will be called on the local system when a backup is created to
    let the module manage its backup. The first argument provided is the backup
    machine name.
  - "backup_<service_name>.sh" will be called on the corresponding container
    when a backup is created to let the module manage/generate its backup. The
    first argument provided is the backup machine name.
  - "disable.pl" will be called on the local system when the module is
    disabled.
  - "disable_<service_name>.sh" will be called on the corresponding
    container to remove the modifications made by the "enable_<service_name>.sh"
    script.
  - "enable.pl" will be called on the local system when the module is installed
    or enabled.
  - "enable_<service_name>.sh" will be called on the corresponding container to
    alter other containers when needed (eg. adding menu items for the module
    features, pre-configuring Drupal modules, etc.).
  - "init.pl" will be called on the local system when the module is installed
    (and enabled).
  - "offline_<service_name>.sh" will be triggered when GenoRing is started in
    "offline" mode.
  - "online_<service_name>.sh" will be triggered when GenoRing is started
    normally (online mode).
  - "restore.pl" will be called on the local system when a backup should be
    restored. The first argument provided is the backup machine name.
  - "restore_<service_name>.sh" will be called on the corresponding container
    when a backup shoud be restored to let the module manage/generate its
    backup restoration. The first argument provided is the backup machine name.
  - "start.pl" will be called on the local system when the GenoRing is started.
  - "state.pl" will be called on the local system when the status of the module
    is needed. When this script is not provided, the system will rely on Docker
    container state. However, in some cases like for the "genoring" service, the
    container might be running but may not be fully initialized. Therefore, such
    a script is needed to get the real container state. The script will just
    output a line with the container state. The ready state string to use is
    'running'. See the corresponding template hook script for more details.
  - "stop.pl" will be called on the local system when the GenoRing is stopped.
  - "uninstall.pl" will be called on the local system when the module is
    disabled and uninstalled. The module will be disabled first and "disable.pl"
    will be called by the system before "uninstall.pl".
  - "update.pl" will be called on the local system when the module is updated.
  - "update_<service_name>.sh" will be called on the corresponding container
    to perform updates.
  Note: When running shell scripts inside containers, the GenoRing "modules"
  directory is copied in the container as "/genoring/modules" and allow access
  to module's files if needed (like the module "res" directory for instance).
  Note: Hook scripts may be called more than one time after a site installation.
  It is up to the script to not perform several time a same operation if it has
  already been done.
- "src": if the module uses custom containers, their sources will be provided
  there in sub-directories corresponding to service names (ie. YAML file names
  without the ".yml" extensions). Service names should always be prefixed with
  "genoring-" to avoid conflicts with other non-GenoRing Docker containers and
  must correspond to a module service name as defined in the module "services"
  directory.
  The "src" must contain at least a "Dockerfile", a "Dockerfile.amd64" or a
  "Dockerfile.arm" file. "Dockerfile", if present, is assumed to be designed for
  amd64 architectures. A "Dockerfile.arm" may be provided but if not, it can be
  automatically generated by GenoRing at compilation time using the amd64
  version. Therefore, it is recommended to only provide a "Dockerfile" and only
  provide others for specific needs that can't be covered automatically.
- "res": if the module needs additional directory and files, that could be
   mounted in containers for instance, they should be put in this resources
   directory.
   Note: Any resource that could be edited by the administrator for
   customization should be copied in a sub-directory of the "./volumes/"
   directory at installation time.
