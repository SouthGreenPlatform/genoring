name: "Name of the module"
description: "A quick description of the module and what it provides."
# The module version (used to support future updates).
version: 1.0
# Minimal version of GenoRing script.
genoring_script_version: 1.0
# services: Optional. The list of services provided by the module.
# Each key is a service machine name with its characteristics.
services:
  genoring-service1:
    name: "Service 1 name"
    description: "Optional service 1 description."
    # The service version
    version: 1.0
  genoring-service2:
    name: "Service 2 name"
    version: 1.0
  #...

# alternatives: Optional. The list of service alternatives.
# Each key is a service alternative machine name with its characteristics.
# Alternative service definitions are placed in the module "services/alt/"
# directory.
# Here "genoring-alternative1" is the machine name of an alternative. Multiple
# alternatives can be defined here, one section after the other.
alternatives:
  genoring-alternative1:
    name: "Alternative 1 name"
    description: "Replaces NGINX server with Apache 2 HTTPd."
    # substitue: Optional. The list of substitued services with their
    # substitution service machine name. Those substitution names must
    # correspond to a YAML file in the module "services/alt/" directory.
    substitue:
      genoring-service1: genoring-alt-service1
    # add: Optional. The list of new services that are added. Those names must
    # correspond to a YAML file in the module "services/alt/" directory.
    add:
    - genoring-new-service1
    # remove: Optional. The list of existing services that are disabled.
    remove:
    - genoring-service2

    # ...

# volumes: Optional. The list of volumes provided by this module. Each key is a
# volume machine name with its characteristics. For "shared" volumes, the type
# must be set to "shared" and the machine name must correspond to a volume
# definition placed in the module "volumes/" directory. "Shared" volume names
# must have a specific structure descibed in the module
# "TEMPLATE/volumes/README.md" file. For other volumes, the machine name must
# start with "genoring-" followed by a dash and the local "volumes" path where
# "volumes" is replaced by "volume" (no "s") and non-word characters are
# replaced by dashes. For example, the Docker volume of the genoring module
# using the path "${GENORING_VOLUMES_DIR}/subdir/some-dir.index" becomes
# "genoring-subdir-some-dir-index".
# Note: anonymous volumes that are not shared nor exposed (in the "volumes"
# directory) do not need to appear here.
volumes:
  genoring-some-volume:
    name: "Some volume name"
    description: "Description of what that volume contains."
    # The volume type (default: "shared"). It can be one of:
    # - "shared" for volumes that are defined by this module and that can be
    #   shared amongst multiple other services and modules.
    # - "exposed" for volumes that are not shared but exposed in the local file
    #   system in the GenoRing "volumes/" directory.
    type: "shared"
    # mapping: Optional. Provides the name of the corresponding directory (or
    # file) in the local file system relative to the GenoRing directory. Do not
    # prefix with "./" or use a trailing slash or environment variables.
    # A starting slash indicates an absolute local file system path.
    mapping: "volumes/somedir"
  module-some-specific-volume:
    name: "Specific volume name"

# dependencies: Optional. Defines module dependencies.
dependencies:
  # Lists required module services (or alternatives) with optional version
  # constraint.
  # Constraints:
  # - REQUIRES: means the module cannot be enabled if the required
  #   module/service (with the optional given version constraint) is not enabled
  #   as well.
  # - CONFLICTS: means the module can not be used of the given module/service
  #   (with the optional given version constraint) is enabled.
  # - BEFORE: means the module service must be started before the given
  #   module/service.
  # - AFTER: means the module service must be started after the given
  #   module/service.
  # Syntax: [PROFILE:][SERVICE] <"REQUIRES"|"CONFLICTS"|"BEFORE"|"AFTER"> CONSTRAINT [or CONSTRAINT] ...
  #   PROFILE: one of "online", "offline" or "backend" (followed by colon). If
  #     no profile is provided, it means it applies to all profiles.
