This directory contains alternative Docker service container definitions that
may be used as replacement of or in addition to default provided services.
Each service should be prefixed by "genoring-" (and not the module name)
to avoid possible conflicts with other Docker services.
The alternatives are defined in the main module YAML file.

See ../genoring-EXAMPLE.yml for a service example.
