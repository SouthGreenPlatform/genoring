This document should explain how to turn this module services into a local
instance.

Typically, it says which files to use, how and what to set on local system to
have things working as expected by other GenoRing modules. It should complete
the GenoRing command "genoring.pl tolocal <SERVICE> <IP>".

It may also explain how to go back to a Docker container instance if needed,
using the command "genoring.pl todocker <SERVICE [ALTERNATIVE]>".
